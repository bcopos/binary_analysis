\section{Abstract}
Automatic identification of bugs remains one of the biggest challenges in security.
Despite widespread research of various approaches, both static and dynamic, the problem remains (REWRITE).
One of the biggest obstacles in automatic testing is thorough exercising of the program.
While fuzzing and symbolic execution can be successful in finding bugs [cite], both approaches have limitations.
To date, there is no alternative for generating input for unknown binaries.
In this paper we present NAME, an architecture and source code independent, instrumentation-free technique for generating valid commands/input for unknown stripped binaries.
NAME exploits side channels to incrementally build valid commands which allow for more extensive testing.

\section{Introduction}



\section{Background}



fuzzers 
symbolic execution limitations (some require source, others require instrumentation, cannot handle floating point instructions, fundamental limitations such as non-linear constraints solving)
lack of architecture independent, source independent, instrumentation free automatic valid input determination.
